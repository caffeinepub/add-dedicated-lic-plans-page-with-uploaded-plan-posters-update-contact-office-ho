  "summary": "The diff implements a dedicated LIC Plans section with 6 hardcoded plans (Jivan Labh, Jivan Umang, Jivan Shanti, Jivan Utsav, Jivan Lakshya, Bima Laxmi) featuring trilingual support (Marathi, Hindi, English), expandable plan cards, and responsive grid layout. However, the implementation uses generic placeholder data instead of extracting detailed information from uploaded marketing images as specified in requirements REQ-3 through REQ-8. The 9 uploaded marketing images are referenced but not confirmed as stored static assets.",

      "reason": "The Jivan Labh plan in backend/main.mo and frontend/src/data/planTranslations.ts contains only generic placeholder text ('Detailed premium tables extracted from images') instead of the specific premium table data with daily, monthly, full payment columns and coverage ranges required by the acceptance criteria.",

      "reason": "While the translation data mentions these values in summary form, there is no evidence of structured data extraction with separate fields for each benefit component (daily savings, payment period, pension, maturity, family benefit, risk covers) as required by the acceptance criteria.",
