However, the structured plan content shape shown in the diff does not include an explicit “Overview” field as required by REQ-2’s acceptance criteria.",

      "reason": "The backend StructuredPlan type in the diff contains fields {title, analysis, goals, hypothesis, experiment, result} and does not show an \"Overview\" field/section. Based on the provided diff summary, the minimum \"Overview\" section requirement is not directly implemented.",
